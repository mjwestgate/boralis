# ggboral
ggplots for multivariate analyses in <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/package=boral">boral</a>. Besides being incomplete, this package also doesn't do anything especially new, and draws heavily on code already provided in boral.

Currently available functions are:
- <code>boral_coefs</code> to export coefficients from a boral model
- <code>ggboral_coefs</code> as a ggplot2 replacement for <code>coefsplot</code>

Coming soon:
- <code>ggboral_lvs</code> as a replacement for <code>lvsplot</code>
- <code>ggboral</code> as a replacement for <code>plot.boral</code>
